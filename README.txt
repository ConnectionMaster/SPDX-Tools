This is a fork of the original project located at https://github.com/goneall/SPDX-Tools.git.

We forked it in order to ease its utilization in other application.
We've mavenized it in order to standardize dependencies management, and allow a more modular project structure.

During the process, we did some refactorings to the source code.
Mainly to compensate for the maven project structure. No big deal functionality wise.
